# Domain-Driven Design (Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software, 2004)

## Preface

  - The author has more than 10 years experience in development of complex systems.
  - The book provides a framework for making design descisions.

## Contrasting Three Projects

  - The author remembers 3 projects:
    1. A project that failed because it was completely missing a design model thus becoming a swamp of code.
    2. A project that emphasized on domain design that had been a great success. Through the model the team and the software stayed alive and responsive to clients needs. The model improved, so did the count of opportunities for the project grow.
    3. A project that emphasized on domain design at first, but then lost its focus, then its vision, and ended up as a modest, conventional project with modest success.
